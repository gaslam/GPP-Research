# GPP-Research

## Introduction

Welcome to the GPP-Research repository by [@gaslam](https://github.com/gaslam). This repository is used for the Exam assignment for Gameplay Programming. A subject that is part of the [Game Development](https://digitalartsandentertainment.be/page/31/Game+Development) course by [Digital Arts and Entertainment](https://digitalartsandentertainment.be/).

For this assignment I had to make 2 projects:
- The Zombie Game
- The Research Topic

Each Project is described below.

# The Zombie Game

## Introduction

The Zombie Game is a project written in C++ using a custom framework made specifically for this assignment. The objective of this game is for the player to control a character by mouseclicks. That character has to collect items like food, guns, ammo to survive waves of Zombies. The intended purpose is to test out the Knowledge gathered throughout this course.

## How to Play

(this section is incomplete. Will add more stuff once I know more about what to do.)

### Controls

**Leftmouse Button:** Set Player movement target.


# Coordinated Group Movement (The Research Topic)

## Introduction
Besides the zombie game, I also had to do a project where I had to do research into a topic of my own choice. For my case, the chosen topic was: Coordinated Group Movement.

### What is Group Movement?
Group Movement is an algorithm mainly used in Real-Time strategy games. It helps characters to move in groups towards the intended destination while still being grouped into a certain shape. That shape could be a circle,rectangle or any shape you can imagine. It's useful to create the feeling that the characters have some intelligence by sticking together in a group.
